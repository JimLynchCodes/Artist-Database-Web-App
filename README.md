# Artist-Database-Web-App

Not sure where the code is, but... when I find it I'll throw it up here!

Browser Webapp that uses javascript, html, and css with Angular.js and Twitter Bootsrap. Inspired from the lynda.com video series [*Up and Running with AngularJS*] (https://www.lynda.com/AngularJS-tutorials/Up-Running-AngularJS/154414-2.html) by Ray villanovos.
